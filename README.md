# 📊 Prodigy InfoTech Internship – Task 01  
## Data Visualization using Bar Chart and Histogram

---

## 📌 Task Objective
The objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using **bar charts** and **histograms** in order to understand data distribution patterns.

---

## 🗂 Dataset Used
- **Dataset Source:** Prodigy InfoTech – Data Science Datasets (Task 01)
- **Dataset Type:** World Bank Population Dataset
- **File Format:** CSV (extracted from ZIP)
- **Key Columns Used:**
  - Country Name (Categorical)
  - Population data for the year 2020 (Continuous)

> Note: Since the dataset does not include age or gender information, population distribution across countries was visualized, which still fulfills the task objective.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the population dataset using Pandas
2. Cleaned the dataset by removing missing values
3. Selected population data for the year 2020
4. Created a **bar chart** to visualize the top 10 most populated countries
5. Created a **histogram** to understand population distribution across countries
6. Interpreted results and summarized insights

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Bar Chart:** Top 10 Most Populated Countries (2020)
- **Histogram:** Population Distribution Across Countries (2020)

These visualizations help in identifying population concentration and distribution patterns.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- A small number of countries account for a very large portion of the global population.
- Most countries fall into lower population ranges, with only a few extremely high-population outliers.
- Bar charts and histograms are effective tools for exploratory data analysis.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This task demonstrates the effective use of data visualization techniques to analyze and understand population distribution. The project highlights the importance of visual tools in identifying trends and patterns in real-world datasets.
